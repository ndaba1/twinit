# Tailwind Init (twinit)

It can be quite a hassle having to visit the tailwind [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) every time you wish to add tailwind to a project.

With twinit, you simply invoke a simple command and the CLI scaffolds everything you need to get up and running with tailwind on your framework of choice. The following frameworks are currently supported, with support for more being worked on:

- [x] CRA
- [x] Next.js
- [x] Gatsby.js
- [x] Remix
- [x] Astro
- [x] Vue.js
- [x] Angular
- [x] Ruby on rails
- [x] Nuxt.js v2
- [x] Solid.js
- [x] Svelte Kit
- [x] Laravel
- [x] Vite using: `React`, `Vue`

## Simply run:

```bash
npx twinit
```
