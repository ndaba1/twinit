# Tailwind Init (twinit)
I love working with tailwindcss, I always use it in every project I create. However, initial setup of tailwind can be cumbersome depending on the framework you intend to use it on. You could configure everything yourself by following instructions from the [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs), you could use starter templates for the framework you're using, or you could use this package(twinit). 

With twinit, you simply invoke a simple command and it scaffolds everything you need to get up and running with tailwind on your framework of choice. The following frameworks are currently supported, with support for the unchecked ones being worked on:
- [x] CRA
- [ ] Next.js
- [ ] Gatsby.js
- [ ] Astro
- [ ] Vue.js (2 & 3)
- [ ] Nuxt.js (v2 & v3)
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Phoenix framework
